## About me
I’ve worked as a pediatric dentist for several years, now I’m on my way to change my professional life completely. From June 1st 2022 I’m an intern tester. My adventure with testing has started 9 months ago and my first experiences with crowdtesting and voluntary projects have shown me that my personality fits here perfectly. 
During internship I had 6 weeks course including testing basics, ISTQB knowledge, introducing to GIT, SQL basics (writing CRUD queries with SELECT, aggregate functions, JOIN functions, subqueries; adding, updating and removing data from data base) and API testing (SoapUI – SOAP and REST API testing using properties, data transfer, assertions with regEx; Postman - creating tests with Chai assertions, variables, environments). Now I’m focused on improving my technical skills (SQL, API testing) and I’ve recently enrolled Python course.

## Repositories
* [Guru99_BankingApp](https://github.com/izasci/Guru99_BankingApp) - test cases and traceability matrix created as a part of live project from Guru99 based on business and functional requirements
* [SQL exercises](https://github.com/izasci/SQL_queries) - queries I've made using SELECT, aggregate functions, JOIN's, subqueries and more, I've worked with MySQL Workbench and free relational database Sakila
* [SOAP API testing calculator](https://github.com/izasci/API_testing) - test cases to check basic functionality of calculator based on [Calculator WSDL](http://www.dneonline.com/calculator.asmx?WSDL), to create test cases I used assertions with regEx, collection properties and data tranfer to perform tests using CRUD workflow
* [REST API CRUD Workflow](https://github.com/izasci/StudentRESTProject) - CRUD Workflow including POST, GET, PUT and DELETE methodes
* [Linux terminal commands exercises](https://github.com/izasci/Linux_terminal_exercises) - basics terminal commands, tasks with answers
* [Calculator written in Python](https://github.com/izasci/pythonCalculator) - exercise from course, console program using 4 basic operations (add, subtract, multiply and divide), as a user we can choose two FLOAT and symbol and after calculate we can use our result form previous operation as a first FLOAT to do next one
* [BlackJackGame](https://github.com/izasci/blackjackGame) - task from python course, popular game with some differences: our deck is unlimited and to choose card is used pseudo-randomization
* [GuessTheNumber](https://github.com/izasci/GuessTheNumberGame) - simple game, computer choose one number(int) in range 1-100, as a user we're guessing, after our guess app display information: too high, too low, you win; there are two levels of game: easy(10 attepts) and hard (5)
* [Coffee Machine](https://github.com/izasci/CoffeeMachine) - user can choose one of 3 drinks if the machine has sufficient ingredients. If not user is informed of it and can choose different one. After making a choice user is asked of coins. App counts coins and give user message with beverage and change or with refunded money. We can also display remaining resources in machine or turn it off.
* [Snake Game](https://github.com/izasci/snakeGame) - SnakeGame well-known simple game using turtle module. Implemented constant movement of snake, randomly appearing food. I've taken care of detecting collision with walls and snake's tail.
* [Pong Arcade Game](https://github.com/izasci/PongArcadeGame) - Game for 2 players, ball is starting movement from position 0, 0 in direction player who won last ball.
